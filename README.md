# robot_auto_nav
Robot_auto_nav is a ROS package for implementing autonomous navigation in a Differential Drive Mobile Robot. The Mobile robot system is driven by two Nissei BLDC Motors, controlled through Arduino microcontroller. The whole algorithm runs in Robot Operating System (ROS) and ROS Navigation Stack has been setup to implement autonomous navigation.
